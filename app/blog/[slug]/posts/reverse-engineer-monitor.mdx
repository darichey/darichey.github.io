A couple weeks ago, I decided to upgrade my home office setup, in particular my monitor.
I bought an [MSI MAG 323UPF](https://us.msi.com/Monitor/MAG-323UPF). For years, I've been
searching for a multi-comptuer/KVM setup that works just the way I want it to, and this
monitor has finally given me that... after a bit of effort.

## The setup
I have a personal desktop and a MacBook for work. The monitor has a built-in KVM switch.
The desktop connects to the monitor via DisplayPort and the USB-B port on the monitor, and the
laptop connects via USB-C (with DisplayPort and Power Delivery). Then there's three 
remaining USB-A 2.0 ports for peripherals.

Out of the box, this setup already works nearly perfectly. I can permanently set the KVM mode to
"Auto" which will make the USB inputs follow the input source. Then I can switch between my
desktop and laptop using the monitor's On Screen Display (OSD) with just a couple of presses of
the joystick on the back of the monitor: 
1. Press right to open the Input Source menu
2. Press up/down to select DP or Type C
3. Press in to confirm

<div className="flex flex-row lg:flex-col gap-4 not-prose ">
  <div className="flex flex-col items-center flex-1">
    <img src="/img/posts/reverse-engineering-monitor/osd_kvm.webp" className="w-full h-auto rounded-lg" />
    <p className="mt-2 text-center text-gray-600">The OSD KVM menu</p>
  </div>
  <div className="flex flex-col items-center flex-1">
    <img src="/img/posts/reverse-engineering-monitor/osd_input.webp" className="w-full h-auto rounded-lg" />
    <p className="mt-2 text-center text-gray-600">The OSD Input Source menu</p>
  </div>
</div>

This works great! Except I noticed something...

## The Button™️
There's a mystery button on the left side of the monitor! Pressing it seemingly does nothing. What could it 
possibly be for??

Actually, I do know what it's for, because I read some reviews of the monitor, but I find it extremely odd that,
as far as I can tell, this button is mentioned no where in MSI's own material on the monitor. The manual mentions
it only once, in a broad overview of the monitor, calling it the "Macro Key".

So what's it for? It's actually kind of neat! You can customize it to perform an action, picking from a list of
actions of varying utility. Things like changing the display preset, or enabling an crosshair, or
**switcing the input source**. Remember earlier I explained the arduous three-step process for switching the
input. I can replace it with just one button! There's just one problem...

## """Gaming Intelligence"""
![](/img/posts/reverse-engineering-monitor/gaming_intelligence.webp)
The way you customize what the monitor's "Macro Key" does is via MSI's """Gaming Intelligence""" app. This app
of course only supports Windows which presents two problems:

1. My Mac doesn't run Windows
2. My desktop doesn't run Windows (I use NixOS, btw)

> Aside: and it's not like I just need the software to customize the button and then it'll do that action from now on,
regardless of the computer the monitor is connected to. No, since potential functionality includes things like
"run a program", there has to be software running on the computer to handle that. If it were **just** a KVM button,
then it could just be in the monitor's firmware, but whatever.

At this point, it would be natural to decide I just can't use the button, and resign myself to the admittedly very
easy aformentioned three-step process for switching the input. After all, I bought the monitor knowing that I
wouldn't be able to use """Gaming Intelligence""" and knowing that the button relied on that.

## Reverse engineering the button

So anyways, I decided to figure out how the button works. At the end of the day, the software running on the computer
is just communicating with the monitor over USB. I can write software that does the same thing. I just need to
figure out what they're saying to each other. So I booted into my Windows partition, installed
"""Gaming Intelligence""", and fired up [WireShark](https://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/USB).

#### Which device?

First, we need to determine which device we're talking to. WireShark inserts
[USB descriptor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/usbcon/usb-descriptors) requests for every
device when capture begins. Looking through the responses, we find our answer: I bet it's the device vendored by
"**M**icro **S**tar **I**nternational" whose address is `1.7.0`.

![](/img/posts/reverse-engineering-monitor/descriptor.webp)

Of course, that address will change, so we're only relying on it to filter the USB traffic for the current session. If we were to
reboot, for example, we would need to repeat the exercise to determine the new address.

Also note that the address being `1.7.0` means we are interested in traffic with any `1.7.x` address. That's because you communicate
with a USB device via different [endpoints](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/usbcon/usb-endpoints-and-their-pipes)
which have different addresses.

We also now have the device's Vendor ID (`0x1462`) and Product ID (`0x3fa4`) which will be useful later.

#### When is the button pressed?

Now let's figure out how to detect when the button is pressed. I filtered down to `1.7.x` and observed the traffic:

This shows USB HID packets being sent between my computer and the monitor. It looks like
the software is periodically sending a request and getting a response.

```

The bodies of these messages are mostly opaque to me, but WireShark tells me that the
first 27 bytes are some kind of header, and the body is the remaining 64 bytes. So
really the request was `01 35 38 30 30 31 31 30 0d` and the response was
`01 35 62 30 30 31 31 30 30 30 30 0d`. These are the same every time.

I've highlighted the responses with that body in red above. Now let's see what happens
if we press the button a couple of times.

  <source src="/img/posts/reverse-engineering-monitor/pressed.mp4" type="video/mp4" />

We get a response with a different body!

```plaintext
0000   1b 00 d0 90 e8 15 06 c7 ff ff 00 00 00 00 09 00   ................
0010   01 01 00 07 00 81 01 40 00 00 00 01 35 62 30 30   .......@....5b00
0020   31 31 30 30 30 31 0d 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   110001..........
0030   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................
0040   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................
0050   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00                  ...........
```

Again, the part we're interested in is just `01 35 62 30 30 31 31 30 30 30 31 0d`.
We can compare that with the response when the button is _not_ pressed...
```plaintext
01 35 62 30 30 31 31 30 30 30 30 0d
01 35 62 30 30 31 31 30 30 30 31 0d
```
... and see that they differ in only a single bit, in the second-to-last byte (`30` vs `31`).
This must encode the button state.

To summarize, it seems like the way the software detects if the button is pressed is by periodically
sending a request asking "was the button pressed?" and the monitor responds, with "yes" or "no" encoded
in the response. We can write a simple Rust program using the [hidapi crate](https://crates.io/crates/hidapi) that
mimics this polling behavior and inspects the response to determine if the button was pressed.
```rust
fn main() {
  let api = hidapi::HidApi::new_without_enumerate().unwrap();
  let (vid, pid) = (0x1462, 0x3FA4); // from the descriptor!
  let device = api.open(vid, pid).unwrap();

  loop {
    let mut buf = [0u8; 65];
    buf[0] = 0x01;
    buf[1] = 0x35;
    buf[2] = 0x38;
    buf[3] = 0x30;
    buf[4] = 0x30;
    buf[5] = 0x31;
    buf[6] = 0x31;
    buf[7] = 0x30;
    buf[8] = 0x0d;
    
    device.write(&buf).unwrap();
    device.read(&mut buf).unwrap();

    if buf[10] == 0x31 {
        println!("BUTTON PRESSED");
    } else {
        println!("not pressed");
    }

    std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(1));
  }
}
```

#### Switching the input

Now we need to know how to tell the monitor to switch inputs. To this point, I had set the button action to just
open """Gaming Intelligence""" to simplify testing. It would have been very annoying to have the monitor switch
inputs every time I pressed the button while testing, and it would've resulted in extra USB traffic to figure out.
Well, now we need to figure it out. Setting the button action to "Switch the input to USB-C" and pressing it
results in this USB traffic:

![](/img/posts/reverse-engineering-monitor/switch_input.webp)

As before, we can see the polling before I press the button, the different response when I press it,
and now a new request being sent to the monitor, highlighted in yellow:

```plaintext
0000   1b 00 10 20 d7 23 06 c7 ff ff 00 00 00 00 09 00   ... .#..........
0010   00 01 00 07 00 02 01 40 00 00 00 01 35 62 30 30   .......@....5b00
0020   35 30 30 30 30 33 0d 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   500003..........
0030   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................
0040   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................
0050   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00                  ...........
```

I repeated this with the button action set to "Switch the input to DP" and saw that the request body differs slightly:

```plaintext
0000   1b 00 50 f3 01 26 06 c7 ff ff 00 00 00 00 09 00   ..P..&..........
0010   00 01 00 07 00 02 01 40 00 00 00 01 35 62 30 30   .......@....5b00
0020   35 30 30 30 30 32 0d 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   500002..........
0030   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................
0040   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................
0050   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00                  ...........
```

Comparing them...

```
01 35 62 30 30 35 30 30 30 30 33 0d
01 35 62 30 30 35 30 30 30 30 32 0d
```

... we see that again they differ in only the last byte (`33` vs `32`). This must encode which input source to select.
We can adjust our Rust program to send this packet after detecing that the button is pressed:

```diff
  if buf[10] == 0x31 {
    println!("BUTTON PRESSED");
+  let mut buf = [0u8; 65];
+  buf[0] = 0x01;
+  buf[1] = 0x35;
+  buf[2] = 0x62;
+  buf[3] = 0x30;
+  buf[4] = 0x30;
+  buf[5] = 0x35;
+  buf[6] = 0x30;
+  buf[7] = 0x30;
+  buf[8] = 0x30;
+  buf[9] = 0x30;
+  buf[10] = 0x33; // or 0x32 for DP
+  buf[11] = 0x0d;
+  device.write(&buf).unwrap();
  } else {
    println!("not pressed");
  }
```

## Conclusion

And... we're done! After some extra polish, I ran the program on both my desktop and laptop and it just worked!

This was super satisfying and a fun little weekend project. I of course left out a lot of details and rabbit holes
that went no where. It took me probably ~10 hours between a couple days to get something that worked. If we say
it took me ~3 seconds with the old input-switching process, and ~1 second with the button, that means I only need to
press it 18,000 times before the time investment starts paying off!! At a rate of a couple presses per day, that's
somewhere between 16 and 25 years. But I had fun. 😄
