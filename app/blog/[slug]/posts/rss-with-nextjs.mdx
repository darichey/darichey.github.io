While fixing up this blog, I decided I wanted to publish an RSS feed for it. I struggled a bit at
first to figure out the best way to do this properly in a fully static Next.js site, so I'm
writing this in case it might help someone in the future.

So... here it is:
```ts
// /app/rss.xml/route.ts
import { Feed } from "feed";

export async function GET() {
  const feed = new Feed({
    title: "David Richey's Blog",
    description: "My personal blog, mostly about programming",
    id: "https://darichey.com",
    link: "https://darichey.com",
    copyright: "All rights reserved",
  });

  // get allMyPosts from somewhere, populate the feed somehow
  for (const post of allMyPosts) {
    feed.addItem({
      title: post.title,
      description: post.subtitle,
      date: new Date(post.date),
      link: post.link,
    });
  }

  return new Response(feed.rss2());
}
```
That's all it takes! You can stop reading now if that's all you need.

## Details
This takes advantage of Next.js [Route Handlers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers).
This approach was non-obvious to me, because, in my goal to create a static site, I had previously dismissed route handlers
as a feature I could use. I viewed them as a purely dynamic thing (how is my static site going to handle a request?), but
that is not the case! Specifically, `GET` handlers ["render to a static file during `next build`"](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports#route-handlers).

In fact... this exact RSS use case [is an example in the docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers#non-ui-responses)! In my defense, I did search ðŸ¥²
![an image of the Next.js docs site with the search query "rss". No results are found.](/img/posts/rss-with-nextjs/search.png)

## Alternatives
Before backing up and considering route handlers, I tried a few different things...
- Writing `out/rss.xml` or `public/rss.xml` in `generateStaticParams()`. I saw a couple resources online recommending this approach, but it is flawed, because it doesn't work correctly in _both_ `next dev` and `next build`.
- Adding an extra step to my build script to run a program to generate `out/rss.xml`. This was annoying, because I couldn't easily share the code for getting `allMyPosts` between the Next.js app and this other program.
- Creating a webpack plugin to generate the file. I was getting truly desparate.

In the end, I'm glad I stopped and read through the docs again, because the final product is infinitely better than any of those!
