A few weeks ago, someone showed me a cool card trick. She also said that the trick was entirely math-based. The
following post documents how I learned how the trick works, formally proving how it works, and generalizing it
to generate new tricks with math!

## The Trick

First, I'll demonstrate the trick as it was demonstrated to me. The trick requires a 21 cards which are laid out
in 3 columns of 7 like so:

TODO: Diagram

The mathemagician asks a volunteer to pick a card and memorize it. Then, the volunteer tells the mathemagician which
column (1, 2, or 3) their card is in. Throughout the trick, this is the only information the volunteer gives about
their chosen card.

Let's play the role of volunteer and pick the two of hearts. It's in the first column, and we tell that to the
mathemagician. They then pick up the cards and deal them out again in an arrangement of 3 columns of 7 (don't worry
about how they do this for now). After they're done, the cards are laid out like so:

Notice that our two of hearts is now in the third column. Again, we tell that to the mathemagician, and they repeat,
laying out the cards like so:

The two of hearts is now in the second column. Giving that information to the mathemagician one final time, they now
pick up all of the cards and deal until flipping over the two of hearts and asking "is this your card?". We are
thoroughly impressed and offer to buy them lunch.

## How it works

Warning! At this point, we peek behind the curtain and ruin the magic...

I'm first going to explain _how_ the trick works (i.e., the process the mathemagician is following). After that, we'll
look at _why_ it works (i.e., the math behind it).

I alluded to how the trick works earlier:

> They then pick up the cards and deal them out again in an arrangement of 3 columns of 7 (don't worry
about how they do this for now)

Of course, its the process by which they pick up and rearrange the cards that is the core of the trick. Upon learning
which column the volunteer's card is in, the mathemagician will pick up the cards in the following order:

1. One of the columns the card _isn't_ in
2. The column the card _is_ in
3. The remaining column

For example, when we said our card was in column 1 earlier, the mathemagician could have picked up the columns in
the order 2, 1, 3 or 3, 1, 2. Here is an example of the former:

TODO Diagram

Either way, column 1 is "in the middle" now. Then, the mathemagician deals the cards into the 3 column arrangement,
left-to-right, top-down, like so:

TODO Diagram

This process is then repeated two more times. When we said our card was in the third column earlier, the mathemagician
picked up the columns in order 1, 3, 2 (or 2, 3, 1), and dealt them again. Then, we said the card was in column 2 and
they picked up the columns in order 1, 2, 3 (or 3, 2, 1).

By this point, _the mathemagician knows exactly where our card is_! It's the TODOth card in the deck! They can
choose to do the big reveal in any number of ways, but they can now correctly guess what card the volunteer chose in
the beginning.

## Why it works

Ok... so we can now blindly follow this process and we'll know that the TODOth card is the volunteer's card... But wait,
what? No matter what card we pick, it will always end up there? Why?

To understand, let's go back to the initial layout of the cards. We're going to assign each "spot" a card can be at a
number, like so:

TODO diagram

We'll call the the "spot" a card is at its _index_. For example, TODO, and our our two of hearts is at index TODO.

We're interested in how a card's index changes each time the cards are rearranged. After the first rearrangement, the
two of hearts is now at index TODO:

TODO diagram

And after the second rearrangement, its at index TODO:

Finally, if the mathemagician were to lay out the cards a third time, the two of hearts would be at index TODO:

TODO diagram

Notice that being at index TODO is the same as being the TODOth card in the deck.

To unlock the "why" behind the trick, we must pay attention to how rearranging the cards changes each card's index. With
each rearrangement, every card gets sent to a new index. For example, we learned the following in tracking the two of
hearts above:

* If the volunteer's card is in column 1, the card at index TODO gets sent to index TODO
* If the volunteer's card is in column 3, the card at index TODO gets sent to index TODO
* If the volunteer's card is in column 2, the card at index TODO gets sent to index TODO

Since the column the volunteer's card is in always gets put in the middle, the indices those cards get sent to are
always the same. Specifically, the first card in the column will be sent to index 7, the second card to index 8,
and so on. This extends the above list of facts like so:

* If the volunteer's card is in column 1...
  - The card at index 0 gets sent to index 7
  - The card at index 1 gets sent to index 8
  - The card at index 2 gets sent to index 9
  - The card at index 3 gets sent to index 10
  - The card at index 4 gets sent to index 11
  - The card at index 5 gets sent to index 12
  - The card at index 6 gets sent to index 13
* If the volunteer's card is in column 2...
  - The card at index 7 gets sent to index 7
  - The card at index 8 gets sent to index 8
  - The card at index 9 gets sent to index 9
  - The card at index 10 gets sent to index 10
  - The card at index 11 gets sent to index 11
  - The card at index 12 gets sent to index 12
  - The card at index 13 gets sent to index 13
* If the volunteer's card is in column 3...
  - The card at index 14 gets sent to index 7
  - The card at index 15 gets sent to index 8
  - The card at index 16 gets sent to index 9
  - The card at index 17 gets sent to index 10
  - The card at index 18 gets sent to index 11
  - The card at index 19 gets sent to index 12
  - The card at index 20 gets sent to index 13

We can formalize this notion of indices being sent to new indices with a function, $f : [0,20] \to [7,13]$ where
$[m,n] = \{i \mid m \leq i \leq n\}$. We could just define this function in terms of the input-output pairs we have
above, but this would make it a bit difficult to work with. Instead, we can define it like so:

$$
f(i) = \left\lfloor \frac{i}{3} \right\rfloor + 7
$$

Take a moment to double check that this gives the desired behavior!

To recap, we have observed that rather than talking about the cards themselves, we can talk about the "spot" or index
each card is at, and we have a function that will tell us the new index of each card in the column the volunteer's card
is in.

At this point, we are well-equipped to formalize the answer to the question "why does this work?". Throughout the trick,
the mathemagician rearranges the cards three times. After the third rearrangement, no matter what card the volunteer
chose at the beginning, it will now be at index 10. Since "card rearrangement" can be represented by $f$, we can
formalize this statement like so:

$$
\forall i \in [0,20].\ f(f(f(i))) = 10
$$

Now, answering "why" is the same as proving this statement... so let's do that! First, we'll expand $f(f(f(i)))$
simply by repeatedly applying the definition of $f$.

$$
\begin{align*}
  f(f(f(i))) & = \left\lfloor \frac{f(f(i))}{3} \right\rfloor + 7 \\
             & = \left\lfloor \frac{ \left\lfloor \frac{f(i)}{3} \right\rfloor + 7 }{3} \right\rfloor + 7 \\
             & = \left\lfloor \frac{ \left\lfloor \frac{ \left\lfloor \frac{i}{3} \right\rfloor + 7 }{3} \right\rfloor + 7 }{3} \right\rfloor + 7 \\
\end{align*}
$$

Yuck! Luckily, we can simplify this a lot by making use of the following property:

$$
\forall m \in \mathbb{Z}.\ \forall n \in \mathbb{Z}^+.\ \left \lfloor \frac{x + m}{n} \right \rfloor = \left \lfloor \frac{\lfloor x \rfloor + m}{n} \right \rfloor
$$

Since $3$ and $7$ are positive integers, we can repeatedly apply this property to get rid of some floors and start simplifying:

$$
\begin{align*}
  f(f(f(i))) & = \left\lfloor \frac{ \left\lfloor \frac{ \left\lfloor \frac{i}{3} \right\rfloor + 7 }{3} \right\rfloor + 7 }{3} \right\rfloor + 7 \\
             & = \left\lfloor \frac{ \left\lfloor \frac{ \frac{i}{3} + 7 }{3} \right\rfloor + 7 }{3} \right\rfloor + 7 \\
             & = \left\lfloor \frac{ \frac{ \frac{i}{3} + 7 }{3} + 7 }{3} \right\rfloor + 7 \\
             & = \left\lfloor \frac{ \frac{ \frac{i}{3} + 7 }{3} + 7 }{3} + 7\right\rfloor \\
             & = \left\lfloor \frac{i + 273}{27} \right\rfloor
\end{align*}
$$

Now, remember that $i$ is at least $0$ and at most $20$. This gives the following inequalities:

$$
\def\arraystretch{1.5}
\begin{array}{rcccl}
\frac{0 + 273}{27} & \leq & \frac{i + 273}{27} & \leq & \frac{20 + 273}{27} \\
10.\overline{1} & \leq & \frac{i + 273}{27} & \leq & 10.\overline{851}
\end{array}
$$

So clearly $\left\lfloor \frac{i + 273}{27} \right\rfloor = 10$.
